## tP1: python & electronics basics
> 🥅 learn the basics of python programming
> 🔩 1x pi pico with micropython per person
- Use micropython - hardware statisfying / direct learning of electronics basics
- [x] blink
- [x] blink x times (functions, serial, (callbacks?))
- [/] sensors & I2C
- [/] add issues to knowledgepase "what would you like to learn?"
- [ ] markdown basics
- [ ] project! - (alarm clock, weather station, LED light show, smart plant watering, IR remote car, digital dice)
- [ ] branding: Name (Bento//WLS), Team names, colors & logo, website, google docs TDM template
- [ ] choose your class: (Elektronik, UI-Programmieren (+website), CAD, ROS programmieren (OpenCV))


> - Cooperative learning  ⚠️different levels - ppl get left behind
> - Dialogue - ask questions and think  ⚠️quiet individuals 
> - Repeating lectures  ⚠️students become dependent on lecturer
> - methods: verbal quizzes, tests, hands-on projects, and written assessment
> - Techniques:
>     - note summarisation - translate code into words you understand
>     - pictures & diagrams
> - Strategies:
      coaching, questioning, mapping concept, problem-solving, reciprocal teaching,
      thinking aloud, reading books, modelling, journal, presenting,
      direct instruction, writing, asking to think, and discussin

      
## tP2: ROS basics
> 🥅 learn the basics of ROS
- [x] `ros2 topic pub/sub`
- [x] Concepts: topic pub/sub, service, 
- [x] programming pub/sub
- [ ] ROS architecture of our robots
- [ ] quick&dirty robot controller
- [/] improve our software (Tunnelvision, Bento-PC)

# Mech

## tM1: Where are we rn?
> 🥅 what needs to be done, learning from mistakes
- [ ] Watch the thing drive, flop, break, you name it
- [ ] Base frame design, mount motors and test


## tM2: designing a robot
> 🥅 design a new robot chassis (use the Design thinking workflow)
- [ ] Empathize: what are the problems at hand
- [ ] Define: which do we want to solve
- [ ] Ideate: what do we want to build - how to solve these selected problems
- [ ] Prototype: cardboard & hotglue model, then makerbeam/wood
- [ ] Test: run the thing in a course!



--- 

- Dual IMUs to get angle between flexible robot chassis segments
- Lay out parts when making design suggestions
  - Batteries horizontal, PC upright, modules in height difference
  - Batteries using mr30 connector → modular, removable
  - Pogo pins for module slots? - they both deffo get USB and power
