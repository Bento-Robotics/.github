# We are WLS Robotics, a school robotics team

## Who are we?
WLS robotics formed in early 2021, as Prof. Dr. Stefan May of the OHM university stumbled across an extracurricular technology course offered by our school, [the WLS](https://loeheschule.de/), and decided to lend support and introduce the world of robotics.

We lay focus on creating simple and easy-to-maintain educational robots using ROS, micro-ROS, [EduArt's drive system](https://github.com/bento-robotics/bento_drive?tab=readme-ov-file#free-kinematics-kit) and off-the-shelf electronics.
With the goal of acquiring and passing on the skills and knowledge required to work on mobile platforms, be it mechanics, electronics, software or just plain old troubleshooting.


## Meet the robots

We began our adventure with Zyklop, using a very simple design and purely hardware from EduArt.  
It is almost twice as large as the other robots, and won't fit into a RMRC course, but it taught us the basics (and most common issues).

Iterating on what we learned from Zyklop, we built the Bento-Box.  
To date this is our most developed robot, with the most features and highest reliability, and champion of the Robocup German open.

However, Bento-Box really struggles at climbing ledges and stairs. As EduArt offered us new hardware, we decided to try out a flipper-based robot, naming it Schäufele.  
We are still learning how to make articulated tracks behave nicely, so Schäufele can be difficult at times. But preliminary results are very promising.

## What happened to team Bento?

To compete at the Robocup RMRC and German open with two robots, Bento-Box and Schäufele, we needed two teams.  
And to clarify our connection to our school, we rebranded to WLS Robotics, with the sub-teams Willi-Bots (Schäufele) and Team Bento (Bento-Box) both competing.
